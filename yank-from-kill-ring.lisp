;; This small plugin replicate the "yank-from-kill-ring" behavior
;; after Emacs 28 (Pop-up paste selection with M-y).

;; Notes that we do not support rotating kill-ring after "Yank From
;; Kill Ring" command, as the kill-ring and copy-paste function behave
;; differently between LispWorks and Emacs, which may result unwanted
;; behaviours after replication.
